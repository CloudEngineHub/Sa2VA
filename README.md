## Overiew
This repository contains the code for the paper "Sa2VA: Marrying SAM2 with LLaVA for Dense Grounded Understanding of Images and Videos".

Sa2VA is the the first unified model for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space.

## Model Zoo
We provide the following models:
| Model Name |                             Base MLLM                             |                                 Language Part                                 |                       HF Link                        |
